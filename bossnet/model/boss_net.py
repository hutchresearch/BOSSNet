class BossNet(torch.nn.Module):
    """
    A class representing the BossNet model for predicting stellar parameters from input spectra and metadata.

    The BossNet model consists of several convolutional blocks, residual blocks, and linear layers.

    Attributes:
    - metadatanet: torch.nn.Sequential, a sequential neural network module that takes metadata as input
      and produces an output tensor of shape (batch_size, 1024).
    - pos_enc: PositionalEncoding1D, an instance of the PositionalEncoding1D class used to apply
      positional encoding to the input spectra.
    - first_conv: ConvolutionBlock1D, a convolutional block used to extract features from the input spectra.
    - res_blocks: torch.nn.ModuleList, a list of residual blocks, where each block is an instance of the
    - ResNetBlock1D class, and each block is connected to the previous block's output tensor and the metadata
      tensor produced by metadatanet.
    - adapt_pool: torch.nn.AdaptiveAvgPool1d, an adaptive average pooling layer used to reduce the spatial
      dimensions of the output tensor from res_blocks.
    - linear_sequential: torch.nn.Sequential, a sequential neural network module that applies several fully
      connected layers to the output tensor from adapt_pool, ultimately producing an output tensor of shape
      (batch_size, 3).

    Methods:
    - forward(x): Performs a forward pass of the BossNet model given input spectra x and metadata m.
      Returns the predicted stellar parameters as a tensor of shape (batch_size, 3).

    Args:
    - x: torch.Tensor, Input tensor of shape (batch_size, 1, flux_length).

    Returns:
    - torch.Tensor, Output tensor of shape (batch_size, 4).
